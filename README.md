# calculator

## simple, fast, easy to use web-based calculator

---

There are additional steps left. I wouldn't use this calculator, so it's not finished. I would want this to run in electron, installed as a quick app on my PC/mobile device. Would save a record of everything I used it for. Let me save a note why I used it. Scales to what I need it easily, this is why I used em in the style. Not all buttons on it work. I'd want more buttons as well, like parenthesis and showing a full calculation before exectuting, and ability to go back to previous ones in history. It reflect my numpad or phone input to make it easier/faster to use. Different modes as well. Add dark/light mode that the user picks.

What did I learn? That I don't fully understand CSS. JS and HTML are easy, but CSS doesn't make sense how Iuse flex. Also some students used grid and we weren't taught that yet, I imagine that would make this project easier. I'll be taking lots of notes and testing things in future CSS lessons.
